We studied the efficacy of federated learning in cervical cancer prediction on three different experimental settings (2~IID, 1~Non-IID). Our proposed CNN-based FL architecture showed a test accuracy of 94.36% and 78.4% on an IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and a non-IID setting respectively. In the mentioned IID setting, three clients were distributed images of all the five classes while in the non-IID setting, each client had images of one distinct class only. The results indicate that FL showed a significant performance over traditional ML algorithms.
